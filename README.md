# ecruit
An online recruiting platform

Ecruit is a platform that maintains user(job seekers) profiles, show them available positions that they are eligible to apply for and then let them apply by providing extra information if needed.
For companies (clients) it lets them post new job, then it displays the status and informaton of the users that have applied to any job opening posted by that particular company.
The admin profile can manage registered companies and user profiles.

Currently the web application uses MYSQL local database and runs on development mode only that is on local host.
